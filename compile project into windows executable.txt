Compilation instructions for generating executable(exe) on Windows x64 architecture.

1.Prerequisites:
a. Install node.js LTS(18.12.1) version from https://nodejs.org/en/download/

b. Install nexe tool.

The fastest and most reliable way to install nexe is simply to run the commands below.

The instructions below are the fastest and most reliable method. Run the following sets of commands with PowerShell (running as Administrator).

Install all required build tools (and dependencies):

Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Force
iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://boxstarter.org/bootstrapper.ps1'))
get-boxstarter -Force
Install-BoxstarterPackage https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nodejs/node/master/tools/bootstrap/windows_boxstarter -DisableReboots
Set config:

npm config set msvs_version 2019
npm config set python python3.8
Where 2019 is the version of Visual Studio you have (if you have it). Otherwise set it to 2022 if you have it.

Notes:

The above works and has been tested with node.js 18.12.1
Python 3 and Python 2 can coexist and nexe will still work, considering the set config area above
Don't use npm install windows-build-tools unless you're having some type of issue, because the above commands configures and installs the latest/preferred tool.


2. Using nexe for generating executable
a. Run npm install in parent folder (where package.json resides)
b. Run nexe index.js -t x64-14.15.3 -o "person" (this will create person.exe)

3. Running the program
a. Run "person.exe/person" or "person.exe/person --help" in command prompt for all the options. The program will self guide.


Final Note: I tried all the possible tools including pkg, electron-packager and electron-builder. The generated executable response is very slow compared to nexe.
For faster execution use README.md steps.
